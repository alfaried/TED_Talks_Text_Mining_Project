# TED Talks Text Mining Project 
TED Talks Kaggle dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks

## Description of Dataset
The TED Talks dataset contains information on all the talks uploaded onto the official website up till
September 21st, 2017. The data sources are split into two csv files: ted_main.csv and transcripts.csv.

The former (ted_main.csv) contains metadata of the talks such as the number of views, number of top-
level comments, description, speakers, titles, ratings, etcetera, whereas the latter (transcripts.csv)

contains the transcripts of each TED Talk. Each record in the datasets are linked to the respective TED
Talk on TED.com via the URL column.

## Justification
The aim of this project is to identify the persuasive techniques that TED Talk speakers employ while
giving their speeches. Our primary stakeholders are individuals who want to improve their speeches
and presentation transcripts. We will focus on a series of tasks (mentioned in the later sections) to
analyse the transcripts and relevant metadata of the talks, and identify the relevant properties to answer
the following questions:
- What makes a TED Talk persuasive or interesting?
- How can a TED Talk be more persuasive? Are there certain words, phrases or topics that make
its persuasiveness more effective?
- Do different topics have different methods of persuasiveness?

Additionally, evaluation on the accuracy of the models used to identify the persuasiveness of a
talk will be done, by comparing it with the ratings given by the viewers themselves within the ted_main.csv dataset.
