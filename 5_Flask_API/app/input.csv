",191555,"So, my name is Roger Doiron, and I have a subversive plot.(Laughter)(Applause)It is so subversive, in fact, that it has the potential to radically alter the balance of power, not only in our own country, but in the entire world. Now I realize, I'm sounding ‚Äî(Laughter)a little bit like Dr. Evil now. I understand that. But trust me ‚Äî we have very, very little in common. His plots are all about destruction and secrecy, whereas my plots are about creation and openness. In fact, my plot can only work if I share it with as many people as possible. So I'm going to share it with you now, but you have to promise me you're going to share it in turn.So here it is. Huh. That's not so good, is it? There's nothing particularly radical or revolutionary about a patch of grass. What starts to get interesting is when we turn it into this.Now, I would like to suggest to you all that gardening is a subversive activity.(Laughter)Think about this: food is a form of energy. It's what our body runs on, but it's also a form of power. And when we encourage people to grow some of their own food, we're encouraging them to take power into their hands, power over their diet, power over their health and some power over their pocketbooks. So I think that's quite subversive, because we're also necessarily talking about taking that power away from someone else, from other actors in society that currently have power over food and health. You can think about who those actors might be.I also look at gardening as a sort of healthy gateway drug, you might say, to other forms of food freedom. It's not long after you plant a garden that you start to say, ""Hey, I need to start to learn how to cook.""(Laughter)""You know, I might want to look into food preservation or I might want to look up where my local farmer's market is located in my town.""Now the other thing, of course, with planting a garden, especially a garden in front of a white house and on a sunny south lawn, is you never know who you might influence.(Laughter)Now, I'm not exactly sure what my white house garden's influence was on the First Lady's, but I can tell you this: she's had an enormous influence on me since planting hers. Now it hasn't been ‚Äî(Laughter)it hasn't been in the area of fashion. I understand that she's just in a completely different league there, and I'm not even trying to compete. But she's really inspired me to think much more boldly about the role that I want to have in the garden movement.And so this is sort of what I'm aspiring to here.(Laughter)Now, pretty modest, right? I like this picture. I think it sort of captures me well, not that I have any divine connections whatsoever, but I like my facial expression there, because, if I've got a worried look on my face, it's not simply because I've got 20 pounds of squash over my head, but it's because I've got some pretty heavy topics on my mind. And I want to share some of those with you right now, starting off in the form of a very short video I've produced for you, which is my best effort to sum up the history of gastronomy in about 15 seconds.(""Also sprach Zarathustra"" plays)(Laughter)So, here we are.(Applause)Now, that's a funny little clip, but it'd be even funnier if it weren't so tragic and if it weren't so true.The reality is that we are in the midst of an obesity epidemic, and it's not simply limited to our country. It's spreading around the world right now. And in a sort of parallel universe, we're also seeing that hunger is on the rise. Over 900 million people right now are affected by it. That's three times the population of the United States. But at the same time, world food prices are rising and world population is rising and is set to reach 10 billion people by the end of the century.Now, another thing about the population is we know that it's increasing, but a lot of us don't realize that it's also changing. There's a fundamental shift taking place. As of 2007, we went from being a primarily rural planet to being a primarily urban one, and that has implications for how we're going to feed these people, how we're going to get the food to the people in the cities. Now, I imagine that there are some Stephen King fans in the audience here, and I'm one of them. But I can tell you, I haven't read anything scarier than this here, and that's this statistic: in order to keep up with the growing population, we're going to need to grow more food over the course of the next 50 years than we have grown over the course of the past 10,000 years combined.What makes this even more challenging is that we're going to need to grow all this food with less, and when I say less, I mean a number of things. Less oil, for example. Most reputable geologists believe that we've already reached peak oil production in the world. Now, you might not think in terms of oil and food as being linked, but there's a very strong link, in fact. It takes 10 calories of fossil fuel energy in our highly industrialized food system in order to produce one calorie of food energy. We'll also need to grow more food with less water. These three images come from three very different parts of the planet, but they all tell the same story of catastrophic drought.We'll also need to grow more food with less farmland. Here, the pressures differ from one place to the next. In the Global South, we're seeing desertification, whereas in the north, we're seeing suburban sprawl.We'll also have to grow more food with less climate stability and less genetic diversity. Now, this is really important. We need our genetic varieties because they're a sort of insurance policy against climate change. We heard earlier today ""not putting all of our eggs in one basket."" Well, we shouldn't be doing the same with our tomatoes, either.We're also going to need to grow more food with less time. Now here, I'm not simply talking about the ticking time bomb that is the global population. I'm talking about the amount of time we all have in order to put a decent meal on the table. And that ""31"" figure there is not something arbitrary. That's the average amount of time the American family spends preparing, eating and cleaning up after meals per day. 31 minutes. So somewhere in there, we're going to need to also fit in growing food. Alright? And I think we do need to do that, but that's also going to mean that somewhere along the way, something's going to have to give. So it sort of leaves us feeling like this.(Laughter)You know? It's time to leave town or even perhaps leave planets. But where do we go? Where do we go when we only have one planet? And where do we go where the going gets tough?Well, if we were to listen to a lot of our political leaders over the years, we would simply go shopping. Right? Because we have this unwavering belief, especially in American political culture, that we can shop our way out of just about any problem. But the reality is something different. We're not going to solve our food problems and our health problems simply by switching from regular Coke to some future green iteration thereof. And although the large food companies would like us to believe that we can give our children all of the vitamins, minerals and immunity-building substances that they need without even leaving the chocolatey cereal aisle ‚Äî(Laughter)the truth is something quite different.Now, what's become even more troublesome of late is that even the foods that ought to be healthy aren't always so, and we're starting to lose confidence in our food system, I think. The bigger it becomes and the more complex it becomes. And we've seen this time and time again. This is an image from the latest E. coli outbreak. In this case, it was in Europe, and we think it was started with bean sprouts, of all things.So we have this sort of shopper's dilemma right now. We have all of these different foods ‚Äî 30,000 foods in the average big-box grocery store ‚Äî but we have less confidence in those foods, and we have less confidence in the actors that are putting those foods on the shelves. I think we need to redefine what good food is. This is an interesting image from Berlin, Germany, where somebody started planting shopping carts and leaving them around. Those are potatoes, by the way.But in addition to redefining what good food is, I think we need to redefine our living spaces. Instead of seeing this as a yard, we need to think of it more as like a full-service greengrocer. That's, in fact, my yard, and that's how I look at it. That's what we transformed our yard into, and I think a really key message is this one: gardens grow good food. And when I say good food, I mean a number of different things. I mean food that is safe, food that is healthy, food that is absolutely gorgeous and delicious.Another important message is this one: gardens grow healthy kids and families. Those happen to be my two youngest sons, and they look healthy and they are healthy, and I think it has to do with the fact that they grew up in gardens and they know where good food comes from. And in fact, they know how to grow some of it themselves. But in the current economy, I think it's key to get this message out, that gardens also grow important economic savings for families. And you can pretty much take my word on this one, because in addition to crunching the vegetables a couple of years ago, my wife and I also crunched the numbers, and we found out that at the end, we had saved well over 2,000 dollars by growing our own food.So you could be asking this question now: If gardens grow all of these great things, how do we grow more gardens? That's, in fact, the question that my organization, Kitchen Gardens International, is both asking and answering. And our answer is essentially this one: we're going to need to leverage the resources and power that we have, the gardens and gardeners that we have, in order to grow and inspire even more. And as I said before, you never know who you might inspire.(Laughter)Now if this campaign was successful, I think it wasn't simply because we had a visionary First Lady taking up residence at the White House ‚Äî that certainly was a major part of it ‚Äî and it wasn't simply because we had some celebrity chefs and authors saying this would be a good idea to do. I think it was ultimately made possible by the fact that there were a lot of people who wanted it to happen. There was a movement that made it happen. And my organization tried to sort of channel some of that energy of the movement and direct it towards the White House. And we had a lot of luck in terms of getting our message out there to the media. We had a petition on Facebook, 110,000 signatures. We had viral images and videos, and we did crazy things like symbolically putting the White House lawn up for sale on eBay.But we need to do even more, and what we're trying to do in my organization is to connect people online, but also to connect people in person. This is an image from a little holiday we invented called ""World Kitchen Garden Day."" It's at the end of August each year, and it's just about bringing people together in gardens to learn from one another, to experience a garden as a community experience. We also need to grow the next generation of gardeners, and we're doing that in the United States and abroad.But there's still so much more that needs to be done, and I think this slide sort of captures where we need to go. We need a road map, and I picked this slide for a reason. We've got a bike garden on the left and a map of the Netherlands on the right. I was in the Netherlands early this year and was absolutely amazed by the amount of bikes on the road; 26 percent of all trips taken in the Netherlands are by bicycle, and it's gotten me thinking: How do we get that happening in terms of food and gardens? How would we get 26 percent of all produce coming from backyard gardens? That might sound like a lot, because we're probably at about two percent at the most right now. But if you take into consideration that at the peak of the victory garden movement last century, 40 percent of all produce was coming from gardens. We can get there again. And I think this is a really good start. The White House garden is certainly very inspirational. That's actually sort of a snapshot of what the garden looked like when it was planted earlier this spring ‚Äî lots of diversity, lots of healthy crops. However, this is not a good representation of our federal agriculture policy.(Laughter)If we were to take the model here, the diagram of that particular garden, and sort of transpose it onto our federal agriculture policy, we'd get this: billions of billions of dollars going to support just a handful of commodity crops with just that tiny little bit at the top for fruits and vegetables. This is scandalous. This is scandalous. We need to do something about this. I think one place we could start is we could look at the tax code. We're already using the tax code to encourage green transport and green shelter. Why not green food? We're in the midst now of talking about another stimulus package. Why not a garden stimulus package? Why not?(Applause)In terms of other things that we need to be doing, we need to move down to the local level and we need to make sure that gardens are legal. This is an illegal garden. At least it was. It's from Michigan earlier this year. It was planted by a woman, a mother of four, and she nearly faced a 93-day jail sentence because she planted it in her front yard. We still have laws from the 20th century. We need to bring our codes up to the realities that we are facing now. We need to figure out also new ways of getting people into gardens, people who don't have yards. I think we also need to set garden entrepreneurism free, and I'm happy to say, as a Mainer, that we are leading the way in this area. Earlier this year, a number of Maine towns passed local food sovereignty laws that allow town residents to not only grow food where they want to grow it but to also sell it the way they want to sell it and to the people they want to sell it to. I think that's an incentive. There are a lot of gardeners out there that would be interested in scaling up their production if they could, if they had a financial incentive.I also think that we need to examine the composition of the movement right now.(Laughter)If the movement were a 1960s beach flick, it would be ""Where The Boys Aren't.""(Laughter)So I'm going to take you to task, guys. It's not right and it's not fair that the burden of this responsibility ‚Äî feeding our country and the world ‚Äî should be with the women. OK?(Applause)And I'm going to challenge the women to come up with really clever, creative ways of getting guys into the gardens, too.(Laughter)Perhaps wearing a bathing suit?(Laughter)But beyond that, I think we need to reexamine the infrastructure that we have in place for gardens. I think we need to create new infrastructure. And this is one of the things my organization is working on right now, sort of a local communications infrastructure, very place-based, that allows people in the same area to connect with one another and to help each other out. I think we're lacking this at the moment ‚Äî(Laughter)but we can do it. The technology is certainly there.In addition to that, I think we need another type of infrastructure. It would be good if we could all get together. I think if we've learned anything through the TED experience, it's that there is power when we bring people together, and I think we need to bring people together at the local level as well. And I think we can take some inspiration from a previous movement, which was the grange movement, a rural movement which brought farmers together in a single building to meet and to recreate and learn how to become better farmers. I think we need a network of suburban granges now.I think one of the last things that we need is to not lose the fun of food. Food is at its best when it's delicious but shared as part of a community, and I think that gardens can get some of that community vibe back as well. So I'm going to leave with one last video, and I'm going to revisit the short video that I showed you before, but I'm going to suggest an alternative ending. And I think this ending is well within our reach, but it's really going to require that we all pull together. So here's the new history of gastronomy.(""Also sprach Zarathustra"" plays)(Applause)(Applause and cheers)Thank you very much. Thank you all. Thank you."

Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs ‚Äî it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me.(Laughter)And you listen to the sounds of silence.(Music)(Applause)Thank you.Good evening and welcome to: ""Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.""(Laughter)When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is ‚Äî first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things ‚Äî Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, """"Me too, and here's my tale of woe."" I call it ""software rage."" And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will ‚Äî Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.(Laughter)Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system ‚Äî this is the good part ‚Äî the entire operating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!(Laughter)So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time.I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that ‚Äî you know how they say, ""Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"" Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD.(Laughter)Which they do.(Laughter)And I have a copy.(Laughter)It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it!So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said,""Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?""She says, ""All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.""(Laughter)And the technician's like, ""Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?""She goes, ""Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'""(Laughter)Well, if you like that one ‚Äî how much time have we got? Another one, a guy called ‚Äî this is absolutely true ‚Äî his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed ""11."" And the technician said, ""What? Why are you typing 11?"" He said, ""The message says, 'Error Type 11.'""(Laughter)So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now?In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, ""We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99."" I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox ‚Äî which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it.I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration.(Laughter)But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, ""Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database."" And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, ""Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."" So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this.(Laughter)This is an un-retouched ‚Äî this is not a joke ‚Äî un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.(Laughter)And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you ‚Äî it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features. So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view.Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.(Applause)Thank you ‚Äî yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. There are these ""wizards"" everywhere. And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard](Laughter)(Applause)""Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard."" Ok, I'll bite. Let's click ""Next"" to continue.(Laughter)(Applause)From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.(Laughter)So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan. So why is ""United States"" in the ""U""s?(Laughter)You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent to put ""United States"" first, but it would be intelligent.This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called ""Start?""(Laughter)Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.(Laughter)And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not ""Print.""(Laughter)(Applause)Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees. He says, ""Nice talk."" And I said, ""Thank you. What do you do here?"" He said, ""I'm a tap counter."" I'm like, ""You're a what?"" He goes, ""Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter."" So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter.(Laughter)This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word ‚Äî it could happen.(Laughter)You go up to the ""File"" menu and you choose ""New."" Now, what happens when you choose ""New?"" Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links ‚Äî by the way, not at the top ‚Äî somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company not counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do.(Laughter)(Applause)The Bill Gates song!(Piano music)I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss.(Laughter)I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code.(Applause)But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code?(Laughter)So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny ‚Äî when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo ‚Äî he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen ‚Äî I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie ""Evita"" ‚Äî(Laughter)with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.(Music)It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.(Laughter)When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz.(Laughter)You try rhyming with garage!(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino.(Laughter)The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar.(Laughter)Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather.(Laughter)(Applause)Thank you.So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share ‚Äî people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.(Laughter)But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won ‚Äî this is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing ‚Äî it's catching on.I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along ‚Äî and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic ‚Äî it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.(Applause)In my very last example ‚Äî I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just ‚Äî you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period. I also use this feature called voice macros; period. Correct ""dissuade."" Not ""just."" Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, ""Thanks for that.""[Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...](Laughter)(Applause)And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail ‚Äî which happens daily ‚Äî I say, ""Piss off.""(Laughter)[I admire your frankness ...](Laughter)(Applause)So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.(Laughter)So the point is ‚Äî this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight? No new features. It's never happened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, ""We'll make this software work right."" Right? Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out ‚Äî 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong ‚Äî and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, ""This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate."" And so that's what they did.This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.CA: Hear, hear!(Applause)"

",20685401,"Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited. My excitement is: I get a chance to give something back. My challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.(Laughter)I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends ‚Äî I do more, obviously, I also coach people ‚Äî but I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language? Not just by learning principles, you got in it and you did it so often that it became real.The bottom line of why I'm here, besides being a crazy mofo, is that ‚Äî I'm not here to motivate you, you don't need that, obviously. Often that's what people think I do, and it's the furthest thing from it. What happens, though, is people say to me, ""I don't need any motivation."" But that's not what I do. I'm the ""why"" guy. I want to know why you do what you do.What is your motive for action? What is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago. Are you running the same pattern? Because I believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated, is the most important thing. I'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life. All of us here have great minds. Most of us here have great minds, right? We all know how to think. With our minds we can rationalize anything. We can make anything happen.I agree with what was described a few days ago, that people work in their self-interest. But we know that that's bullshit at times. You don't work in your self-interest all the time, because when emotion comes into it, the wiring changes in the way it functions. So it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is, especially those who are very smart can play this game in our head. But I really want to know what's driving you.What I would like to invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons. One: so that you can contribute more. And two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more, but appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today. They're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us, because it's making us intersect. That intersection doesn't always create a view of ""everybody now understands everybody, and everybody appreciates everybody.""I've had an obsession basically for 30 years, ""What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives? What in their performance?"" I got hired to produce the result now. I've done it for 30 years. I get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television, and they were ahead by five strokes and now they can't get back on the course. I've got to do something right now or nothing matters. I get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide, I've got to do something. In 29 years, I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one. It doesn't mean I won't some day, but I haven't yet. The reason is an understanding of these human needs.When I get those calls about performance, that's one thing. How do you make a change? I'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute, to do something beyond themselves. Maybe the real question is, I look at life and say there's two master lessons. One is: there's the science of achievement, which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly. ""How do you take the invisible and make it visible,"" How do you make your dreams happen? Your business, your contribution to society, money ‚Äî whatever, your body, your family.The other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment. Because science is easy, right? We know the rules, you write the code and you get the results. Once you know the game, you just up the ante, don't you? But when it comes to fulfillment ‚Äî that's an art. The reason is, it's about appreciation and contribution. You can only feel so much by yourself.I've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question how somebody's life changes if you look at them like those people that you've given everything to? Like all the resources they say they need. You gave not a 100-dollar computer, but the best computer. You gave them love, joy, were there to comfort them. Those people very often ‚Äî you know some of them ‚Äî end up the rest of their life with all this love, education, money and background going in and out of rehab. Some people have been through ultimate pain, psychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused ‚Äî and not always, but often, they become some of the people that contribute the most to society.The question we've got to ask ourselves really is, what is it? What is it that shapes us? We live in a therapy culture. Most of us don't do that, but the culture's a therapy culture, the mindset that we are our past. And you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that, but most of society thinks biography is destiny. The past equals the future. Of course it does if you live there. But what we know and what we have to remind ourselves ‚Äî because you can know something intellectually and then not use it, not apply it.We've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power. When you ask people, have you failed to achieve something significant in your life?Say, ""Aye."" Audience: Aye.TR: Thanks for the interaction on a high level there. But if you ask people, why didn't you achieve something? Somebody who's working for you, or a partner, or even yourself. When you fail to achieve, what's the reason people say? What do they tell you? Didn't have the knowledge, didn't have the money, didn't have the time, didn't have the technology. I didn't have the right manager.Al Gore: Supreme Court. TR: The Supreme Court.(Laughter)(Applause) (Cheering)(Applause continues)TR: And ‚Äî(Applause)What do all those, including the Supreme Court, have in common?(Laughter)They are a claim to you missing resources, and they may be accurate. You may not have the money, or the Supreme Court, but that is not the defining factor.(Applause) (Laughter)And you correct me if I'm wrong. The defining factor is never resources; it's resourcefulness. And what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase, is if you have emotion, human emotion, something that I experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced and I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won.Audience: Yeah!(Applause) (Cheering)How easy for me to tell him what he should do.(Laughter)Idiot, Robbins. But I know when we watched the debate at that time, there were emotions that blocked people's ability to get this man's intellect and capacity. And the way that it came across to some people on that day ‚Äî because I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't, and I was upset. But there was emotion there. Do you know what I'm talking about?Say, ""Aye."" Audience: Aye.TR: So, emotion is it. And if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything. If you're creative, playful, fun enough, can you get through to anybody, yes or no?If you don't have the money, but you're creative and determined, you find the way. This is the ultimate resource. But this is not the story that people tell us. They tell us a bunch of different stories. They tell us we don't have the resources, but ultimately, if you take a look here, they say, what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that? He's broken my pattern, that son-of-a-bitch.(Laughter)But I appreciated the energy, I'll tell you that.(Laughter)What determines your resources? We've said decisions shape destiny, which is my focus here. If decisions shape destiny, what determines it is three decisions. What will you focus on? You have to decide what you're going to focus on. Consciously or unconsciously. the minute you decide to focus, you must give it a meaning, and that meaning produces emotion. Is this the end or the beginning? Is God punishing me or rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice? An emotion creates what we're going to do, or the action.So, think about your own life, the decisions that have shaped your destiny. And that sounds really heavy, but in the last five or 10 years, have there been some decisions that if you'd made a different decision, your life would be completely different? How many can think about it? Better or worse. Say, ""Aye.""Audience: Aye.So the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work, and you met the love of your life there, a career decision. I know the Google geniuses I saw here ‚Äî I mean, I understand that their decision was to sell their technology. What if they made that decision versus to build their own culture? How would the world or their lives be different, their impact? The history of our world is these decisions. When a woman stands up and says, ""No, I won't go to the back of the bus."" She didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture. Or someone standing in front of a tank. Or being in a position like Lance Armstrong, ""You've got testicular cancer."" That's pretty tough for any male, especially if you ride a bike.(Laughter)You've got it in your brain; you've got it in your lungs. But what was his decision of what to focus on? Different than most people. What did it mean? It wasn't the end; it was the beginning. He goes off and wins seven championships he never once won before the cancer, because he got emotional fitness, psychological strength. That's the difference in human beings that I've seen of the three million I've been around.In my lab, I've had three million people from 80 countries over the last 29 years. And after a while, patterns become obvious. You see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way, right? Others say, ""Oh, that sounds ridiculous."" It's simple. So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you? Two invisible forces. Very quickly. One: state. We all have had times, you did something, and after, you thought to yourself, ""I can't believe I said or did that, that was so stupid."" Who's been there? Say, ""Aye."" Audience: Aye.Or after you did something, you go, ""That was me!""(Laughter)It wasn't your ability; it was your state. Your model of the world is what shapes you long term. Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us. It makes people make decisions. To influence somebody, we need to know what already influences them. It's made up of three parts. First, what's your target? What are you after? It's not your desires. You can get your desires or goals. Who has ever got a goal or desire and thought, is this all there is?Say, ""Aye."" Audience: Aye.It's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs. Second, once you know what the target that's driving you is and you uncover it for the truth ‚Äî you don't form it ‚Äî then you find out what's your map, what's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs. Some people think the way to get them is to destroy the world, some people, to build, create something, love someone. There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs.Let me tell you what they are. First one: certainty. These are not goals or desires, these are universal. Everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable. Now, how do you get it? Control everybody? Develop a skill? Give up? Smoke a cigarette? And if you got totally certain, ironically, even though we need that ‚Äî you're not certain about your health, or your children, or money. If you're not sure the ceiling will hold up, you won't listen to any speaker. While we go for certainty differently, if we get total certainty, we get what? What do you feel if you're certain? You know what will happen, when and how it will happen, what would you feel? Bored out of your minds. So, God, in Her infinite wisdom, gave us a second human need, which is uncertainty. We need variety. We need surprise. How many of you here love surprises? Say, ""Aye.""Audience: Aye.TR: Bullshit. You like the surprises you want. The ones you don't want, you call problems, but you need them. So, variety is important. Have you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen? Who's done this? Get a fucking life.(Laughter)Why are you doing it? You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before, but you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten, and there's variety.Third human need, critical: significance. We all need to feel important, special, unique. You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual. You can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put more tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know. Whatever it takes. The fastest way to do this, if you have no background, no culture, no belief and resources or resourcefulness, is violence. If I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant. Zero to 10. How high? 10. How certain am I that you're going to respond to me? 10. How much uncertainty? Who knows what's going to happen next? Kind of exciting. Like climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff all the way down there. Total variety and uncertainty. And it's significant, isn't it? So you want to risk your life for it. So that's why violence has always been around and will be around unless we have a consciousness change as a species. You can get significance a million ways, but to be significant, you've got to be unique and different.Here's what we really need: connection and love, fourth need. We all want it; most settle for connection, love's too scary. Who here has been hurt in an intimate relationship? If you don't raise your hand, you've had other shit, too. And you're going to get hurt again. Aren't you glad you came to this positive visit? Here's what's true: we need it. We can do it through intimacy, friendship, prayer, through walking in nature. If nothing else works for you, don't get a cat, get a dog, because if you leave for two minutes, it's like you've been gone six months, when you come back 5 minutes later.These first four needs, every human finds a way to meet. Even if you lie to yourself, you need to have split personalities. I call the first four needs the needs of the personality. The last two are the needs of the spirit. And this is where fulfillment comes. You won't get it from the first four. You'll figure a way, smoke, drink, do whatever, meet the first four. But number five, you must grow. We all know the answer. If you don't grow, you're what? If a relationship or business is not growing, if you're not growing, doesn't matter how much money or friends you have, how many love you, you feel like hell. And I believe the reason we grow is so we have something to give of value.Because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves. Because we all know, corny as that sounds, the secret to living is giving. We all know life is not about me, it's about we. This culture knows that, this room knows that. It's exciting. When you see Nicholas talking about his $100 computer, the most exciting thing is: here's a genius, but he's got a calling now. You can feel the difference in him, and it's beautiful. And that calling can touch other people.My life was touched because when I was 11 years old, Thanksgiving, no money, no food, we were not going to starve, but my father was totally messed up, my mom was letting him know how bad he messed up, and somebody came to the door and delivered food. My father made three decisions, I know what they were, briefly. His focus was ""This is charity. What does it mean? I'm worthless. What do I have to do? Leave my family,"" which he did. It was one of the most painful experiences of life. My three decisions gave me a different path. I set focus on ""There's food."" What a concept!(Laughter)But this is what changed my life, shaped me as a human being. Somebody's gift, I don't even know who it is. My father always said, ""No one gives a shit."" And now somebody I don't know, they're not asking for anything, just giving us food, looking out for us. It made me believe this: that strangers care. And that made me decide, if strangers care about me and my family, I care about them. I'm going to do something to make a difference. So when I was 17, I went out on Thanksgiving, it was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families. The most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life. Next year, I did four, then eight. I didn't tell anybody what I was doing, I wasn't doing it for brownie points. But after eight, I thought I could use some help.So I went out, got my friends involved, then I grew companies, got 11, and I built the foundation. 18 years later, I'm proud to tell you last year we fed 2 million people in 35 countries through our foundation. All during the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, in different countries around the world.(Applause)Thank you. I don't tell you that to brag, but because I'm proud of human beings because they get excited to contribute once they've had the chance to experience it, not talk about it.So, finally ‚Äî I'm about out of time. The target that shapes you ‚Äî Here's what's different about people. We have the same needs. But are you a certainty freak, is that what you value most, or uncertainty? This man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves. Are you driven by significance or love? We all need all six, but what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction. And as you move in a direction, you have a destination or destiny. The second piece is the map. The operating system tells you how to get there, and some people's map is, ""I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people,"" and they're a fireman, and somebody else says, ""I'm going to kill people to do it."" They're trying to meet the same needs of significance. They want to honor God or honor their family. But they have a different map.And there are seven different beliefs; I can't go through them, because I'm done. The last piece is emotion. One of the parts of the map is like time. Some people's idea of a long time is 100 years. Somebody else's is three seconds, which is what I have. And the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you. If you've got a target and a map ‚Äî I can't use Google because I love Macs, and they haven't made it good for Macs yet. So if you use MapQuest ‚Äî how many have made this fatal mistake of using it? You use this thing and you don't get there. Imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go.(Laughter)The last thing is emotion. Here's what I'll tell you about emotion. There are 6,000 emotions that we have words for in the English language, which is just a linguistic representation that changes by language. But if your dominant emotions ‚Äî If I have 20,000 people or 1,000 and I have them write down all the emotions that they experience in an average week, and I give them as long as they need, and on one side they write empowering emotions, the other's disempowering, guess how many emotions they experience? Less than 12. And half of those make them feel like shit. They have six good feelings. Happy, happy, excited, oh shit, frustrated, frustrated, overwhelmed, depressed. How many of you know somebody who, no matter what happens, finds a way to get pissed off?(Laughter)Or no matter what happens, they find a way to be happy or excited. How many of you know somebody like this?When 9/11 happened, I'll finish with this, I was in Hawaii. I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries, we were translating four languages simultaneously for a program I was conducting, for a week. The night before was called Emotional Mastery. I got up, had no plan for this, and I said ‚Äî we had fireworks, I do crazy shit, fun stuff, and at the end, I stopped. I had this plan, but I never know what I'm going to say. And all of a sudden, I said, ""When do people really start to live? When they face death."" And I went through this whole thing about, if you weren't going to get off this island, if nine days from now, you were going to die, who would you call, what would you say, what would you do? That night is when 9/11 happened.One woman had come to the seminar, and when she came there, her previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered. Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her, and she said no.He said, ""If you go to that Hawaii thing, it's over with us."" She said, ""It's over."" When I finished that night, she called him and left a message at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked, saying, ""I love you, I want you to know I want to marry you. It was stupid of me."" She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back, and said, ""Honey, I can't tell you what this means. I don't know how to tell you this, but you gave me the greatest gift, because I'm going to die."" And she played the recording for us in the room. She was on Larry King later. And he said, ""You're probably wondering how on Earth this could happen to you twice. All I can say is this must be God's message to you. From now on, every day, give your all, love your all. Don't let anything ever stop you."" She finishes, and a man stands up, and he says, ""I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim. I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry, but frankly, this is retribution."" I can't tell you the rest, because I'm out of time.(Laughter)Are you sure?(Laughter)10 seconds!(Laughter and applause)10 seconds, I want to be respectful. All I can tell you is, I brought this man on stage with a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center, because I had about 200 New Yorkers there. More than 50 lost their entire companies, friends, marking off their Palm Pilots. One financial trader, woman made of steel, bawling ‚Äî 30 friends crossing off that all died. And I said, ""What are we going to focus on? What does this mean and what are we going to do?""And I got the group to focus on: if you didn't lose somebody today, your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else. Then one woman stood up and was so angry, screaming and yelling. I found out she wasn't from New York, she's not an American, doesn't know anybody here. I asked, ""Do you always get angry?"" She said, ""Yes."" Guilty people got guilty, sad people got sad. I took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation. Jewish man with family in the occupied territory, someone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day, and this man who wanted to be a terrorist, and I made it very clear. This integration is on a film, which I'd be happy to send you, instead of my verbalization, but the two of them not only came together and changed their beliefs and models of the world, but worked together to bring, for almost four years now, through various mosques and synagogues, the idea of how to create peace. And he wrote a book, called ""My Jihad, My Way of Peace."" So, transformation can happen.My invitation to you is: explore your web, the web in here ‚Äî the needs, the beliefs, the emotions that are controlling you, for two reasons: so there's more of you to give, and achieve, too, but I mean give, because that's what's going to fill you up. And secondly, so you can appreciate ‚Äî not just understand, that's intellectual, that's the mind, but appreciate what's driving other people. It's the only way our world's going to change.God bless you, thank you. I hope this was of service.(Applause)"
